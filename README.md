# raytracer

A very simple no-frills raytracer. The user can define a scene by placing spheres and cubes on given coordinates, and giving a camera position and angle. When the scene is rendered, a section of a plane defined by the camera position and angle "shoots" rays. If these rays intersect the cubes or spheres in the scene, the ray is reflected towards a new direction, or color the ray hits is recorded.
